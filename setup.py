systemd Service Notification

This is a pure Python implementation of the systemd sd_notify protocol. This protocol can be used to inform systemd about service start-up completion, watchdog events, and other service status changes. Thus, this package can be used to write system services in Python that play nicely with systemd. sdnotify is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
